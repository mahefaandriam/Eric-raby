These qualities, forged on the basketball courts, have shaped his approach to supporting children and parents in achieving their projects (academic, sports, professional).",
        "3" : "Specializing in impact and kindness, Éric has focused on supporting adolescents, a period often marked by doubts, questions, and a lack of motivation. Through the PCP method (Person-Centered Approach), he creates a safe space where each young person can express their needs and work on their goals. His role is to help adolescents reconnect with their potential, overcome obstacles, and strengthen their self-confidence. Through this personalized approach, he guides them to become aware of their strengths and aspirations, in order to find a clear path towards the future. This awareness includes parents in the success of their children.",
