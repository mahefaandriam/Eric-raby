Through the <method>PCP method</method> (Person-Centered Approach), he creates a safe space where each young person can express their needs and work on their goals. His role is to help adolescents reconnect with their potential, overcome obstacles, and strengthen their self-confidence. Through this personalized approach, he guides them to become aware of their <strengths>strengths and aspirations</strengths>, in order to find a clear path towards the future. This awareness includes parents in the success of their children.\n\nA telling example: <teen>Ines</teen>, a teenager struggling academically, was able to rediscover her passions and positively redirect her goals. She was supported to overcome her blocks, regain motivation, and embark on a more fulfilling path.\n\nIn addition to his expertise in personal development, <name>Éric</name> holds a diploma in <cert>sports team management</cert> registered with the <org>DRAJES</org> (Regional Directorate of Youth, Sports, and Social Cohesion).
